Hey! I'm a recent Computer Science grad from Western University with a passion for building things that actually matter. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve been lucky to work on some pretty cool projects â€” from developing internal apps at a healthcare institute, to revamping university websites, to digitizing rock samples in a geology lab (yes, really).                        </p>
                        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
Iâ€™ve dabbled in everything from frontend design to backend logic, and I enjoy finding smart, simple ways to solve real-world problems with code. Iâ€™ve also had the chance to work with all kinds of people â€” developers, designers, researchers, and even students â€” which taught me a lot about communication, collaboration, and adapting fast.                        </p>
                        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
Outside of the tech world, youâ€™ll probably catch me gaming, at the gym, or jumping into new hobbies for fun. Iâ€™m currently on the hunt for an entry-level or new grad software role where I can grow, learn, and make an impact.
                        </p>
